\subsection{Document Structure}

The document is segmented in 9 chapters, this one being the introduction for the research. Chapters \ref{section:bgd_wlan} and \ref{section:bgd_isp_proto} respectively discuss the background knowledge in Wireless Networks and \gls{isp}-side Protocols. The \glspl{cpe} analyzed by the research are specified in Chapter \ref{section:cpe_research_data}, the method used to prepare the devices is explained, and data is collected from them. In Chapter \ref{section:config_analysis}, the configuration data collected in each \gls{cpe} is inspected and the values set are discussed. The security of the \gls{http} Management Interface of the devices is assessed on Chapter \ref{section:http_mgt_iface}. Chapter \ref{section:isp_svc_analysis} analyzes the implementation of some \gls{isp}-side Services. The possibility of switching the \gls{isp}-provided \gls{cpe} with another equipment is researched on Chapter \ref{section:subs_isp_cpe}, instructing how to do so. Finally, Chapter \ref{section:conclusion} exposes the conclusion of this work.
