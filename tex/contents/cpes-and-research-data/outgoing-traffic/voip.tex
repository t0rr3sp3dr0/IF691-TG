\subsubsection{VoIP}

\gls{sip} traffic was identified on \glspl{cpe} that were bound to customers subscribed to the \gls{voip} service of the \gls{isp}. The captured traffic shows that \gls{tls} is not used and the transport protocol utilized is \gls{udp}. The destination of the packets was \url{192.168.80.1:5060}, which acts as a \gls{sip} Outbound Proxy.

By inspecting the content of \gls{sip} requests, it was able to verify that \url{ims3.gvt.net.br} was being used as the \gls{sip} registrar and the \gls{sip} realm. For the username, the customerâ€™s phone number formatted with the E.164 standard was used. The password could not be retrieved in plaintext, as it is sent hashed and would require brute-forcing to reveal its contents.
