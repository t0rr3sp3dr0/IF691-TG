\subsubsection{IPTV}

Unfortunately, it wasn’t possible to capture \gls{iptv} data as the test environment doesn’t have a subscription to the \gls{isp} \gls{iptv} service. But it was possible to identify that similar to the \gls{voip} service, the \gls{iptv} has a dedicated \gls{vlan} for it, number 602, on fiber-based \gls{cpe}s.
