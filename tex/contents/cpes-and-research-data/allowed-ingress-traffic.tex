\subsection{Allowed Ingress Traffic}

The nmap tool \cite{nmap} was used to look for open \gls{tcp} and \gls{udp} ports on the \gls{cpe} under analysis. Additionally, the ping tool \cite{ping} was also executed to check if \gls{icmp} traffic was allowed.

First, both tools were used from inside the \gls{lan} towards the \gls{cpe}’s private \gls{ip}, listing which ports were exposed to the local network. The execution of both tools is shown on Figure \ref{figure:cpe_allowed_ingress_traffic}.

\end{figure}

Then, to detect the ports exposed to the broadband network, the \gls{cpe} had to be connected to the copper or fiber cable of the \gls{isp} to acquire a public \gls{ip} address. The tools were executed from a device on the \gls{wan}, directing the scan to the \gls{cpe}’s public \gls{ip}.

Table \ref{table:cpes_ingress} presents all ingress traffic allowed by the \gls{cpe} on both \gls{lan} and \gls{wan} sides.
