\subsection{Subjects}

The chosen \gls{isp} has two main offerings for their residential Internet service, copper and fiber. For each transmission medium, the \gls{isp} deploys different equipment as a residential gateway, that have been majorly manufactured by Askey and MitraStar in recent years.

This study will analyze 8 of those \gls{cpe}s, as specified on Table \ref{table:cpes_identifiers}. An equal number of copper and fiber devices was selected, as well as the number of Askey and MitraStar equipment.

\begin{table}[h]
    \makebox[\linewidth]{
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
            \thead{\gls{cpe} Identifier} & \thead{Transmission Medium} & \thead{Manufacturer Name} & \thead{Model Number} \\
            \hline
            \gls{cpe}-0 & Copper & Askey & \texttt{RTA9227W-D112} \\
            \gls{cpe}-1 & Copper & Askey & \texttt{RTV9015VW} \\
            \gls{cpe}-2 & Copper & MitraStar & \texttt{DSL-100HN-T1-NV} \\
            \gls{cpe}-3 & Copper & MitraStar & \texttt{DSL-2401HN2-E1C} \\
            \gls{cpe}-4 & Fiber & Askey & \texttt{RTF3505VW-N2} \\
            \gls{cpe}-5 & Fiber & Askey & \texttt{RTF8115VW} \\
            \gls{cpe}-6 & Fiber & MitraStar & \texttt{GPT-2541GNAC-N1} \\
            \gls{cpe}-7 & Fiber & MitraStar & \texttt{GPT-2731GN2A4P} \\
        \end{tabular}
    }
    \caption{Identifiers of the \gls{cpe}s}
    \label{table:cpes_identifiers}
\end{table}

The \glspl{cpe} analyzed include all models that were leased by the \gls{isp} to the customers part of the research. Other models were incorporated into the analysis based on a list of devices on the \gls{isp} support page \cite{vivo_configuraraparelhos}.
