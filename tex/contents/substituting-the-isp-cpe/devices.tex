\subsection{Devices}

To cover both \gls{isp} offerings, copper-based and fiber-based devices were used on the test, as presented on Table \ref{table:crgs_identifiers}. The devices are manufactured by TP-Link and are designed for residential use. They have \gls{rj11} ports that allow analog telephones to be connected to the \gls{voip} service of the \gls{isp}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \makebox[\linewidth]{
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
            \thead{\gls{crg} Identifier} & \thead{Transmission Medium} & \thead{Manufacturer Name} & \thead{Model Number} \\
            \hline
            \gls{crg}-0 & Copper & TP-Link & \texttt{Archer VR600v} \\
            \gls{crg}-1 & Fiber & TP-Link & \texttt{Archer XR500v} \\
        \end{tabular}
    }
    \caption{Identifiers of the \gls{crg}s}
    \label{table:crgs_identifiers}
\end{table}

The configuration applied on the devices is based on the data collected from the \gls{isp} \gls{cpe}s. Further analysis may be necessary to determine the proper setup for the new equipment.
