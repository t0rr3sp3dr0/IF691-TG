\section{Background in ISP-side Protocols}
\label{section:bgd_isp_proto}

This chapter explore some protocols that are used by the \gls{cpe} to communicate with the \gls{isp} and the other way around. Two protocols are analyzed: one allows the \gls{isp} to manage the \glspl{cpe} remotely, and the other is used by the \gls{cpe} to access the voice service of the provider.
