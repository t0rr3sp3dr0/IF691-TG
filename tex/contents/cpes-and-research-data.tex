\section{CPEs and Research Data}
\label{section:cpe_research_data}

This chapter lists all \glspl{cpe} being analyzed, including the manufacturer name, the model number, and the transmission medium supported by the device. Each device is assigned an identifier that is used throughout this work.

Then it is explained how each \gls{cpe} is prepared before any data is collected or any experiment is executed. The state that the \gls{cpe} is put in resembles its state as soon as the equipment is installed by the \gls{isp} on the customerâ€™s home.

Finally some data is collected from the device enclosure, the wireless network being broadcasted, the management interfaces, and the configuration file of each \gls{cpe}. This data is analyzed in the next chapters.
