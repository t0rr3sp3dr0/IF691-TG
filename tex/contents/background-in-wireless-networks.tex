\section{Background in Wireless Networks}
\label{section:bgd_wlan}

In this chapter, the origins and the motivation underneath \gls{wifi} is exposed. The different authentication and encryption protocols are detailed, as defined by the \gls{ieee}, and have their security problems explained.

The research covers Open System and \gls{weo} standards, for unauthenticated or open networks; \gls{wep}, \gls{wpa}, \gls{wpa}2, and \gls{wpa}3 standards, for authenticated or closed networks; and \gls{wps} and \gls{wec} standards, for quick setup networks.

The knowledge acquired in this chapter is later used for the security assessment of the \glspl{cpe} and to better understand the impact of the configurations set.
