\subsubsection{Open System}

The Open System authentication is essentially a null authentication algorithm \cite{ieee_80211_2020}. Any wireless client may become authenticated if the target of the request is configured to use this kind of authentication, although the recipient is not required to accept the authentication request and may decline it.
