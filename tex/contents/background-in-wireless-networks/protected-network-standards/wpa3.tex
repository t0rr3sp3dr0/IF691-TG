\subsubsection{WPA3}

14 years after the \gls{wpa}2 release, \gls{wpa}3 was published. The new protocol is based on the \gls{ieee} 802.11-2016 revision and comes with a new handshake process that makes offline dictionary attacks impossible \cite{wpa3_spec}. \gls{wpa}3 retains interoperability with \gls{wpa}2 devices via the Transition Mode and must be supported by all \gls{wifi} devices certified since July 2020.
