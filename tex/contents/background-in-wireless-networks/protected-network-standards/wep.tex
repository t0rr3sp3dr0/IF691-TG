\subsubsection{WEP}

The \gls{wep} algorithm is part of the original \gls{ieee} 802.11 standard and was intended to avoid eavesdropping and ensure privacy for those connected to a wireless network \cite{ieee_80211_2020}.

It relies on a secret that is known by the station and has been delivered to the wireless client, presumably via a secure channel, to accept or decline the authentication request. An encrypted challenge is sent to the client, which decrypts it using the shared key and sends the decrypted challenge back to the station, proving that it knows the password, thus should be authenticated successfully.
