\subsubsection{WPA2}

In 2004, the \gls{ieee} 802.11i amendment was finalized and published and, as planned, the \gls{wifi} Alliance released a new protocol based on the document, \gls{wpa}2 \cite{wifi_state}. Unlike its predecessor, \gls{wpa}2 wasnâ€™t designed to work with older hardware constraints and could provide more robust security mechanisms.

One of the key differences between \gls{wpa} and \gls{wpa}2 is its confidentiality and integrity protocol. On \gls{wpa} it was optional to have the new protocol implemented, while on \gls{wpa}2 its implementation is mandatory and \gls{tkip} should only be used as a fallback for interoperability with older devices.

\gls{wpa}2 relies on the same authenticators of \gls{wpa}, \gls{psk} for \gls{wpa}2-Personal and \gls{ieee} 802.1X for \gls{wpa}2-Enterprise.
