\paragraph{SAE}

The \gls{sae} protocol was originally defined on the \gls{ieee} 802.11s amendment for use on mesh networks \cite{ieee_80211_2020}. It is a variant of the Dragonfly Key Exchange \cite{rfc7664}, meant to provide an authentication mechanism resistant to offline brute-force attacks. \gls{sae} relies on discrete logarithm cryptography to achieve its security properties. The password derivation is made using one of the hash-to-curve functions specified in the protocol.

In the \gls{ieee} 802.11-2016 revision, the use of \gls{sae} was broadened to act as a replacement for the \gls{psk} authenticator of traditional wireless networks, allowing \gls{wifi} Alliance to define it as the authentication protocol for \gls{wpa}3-Personal networks \cite{wpa3_spec}.
